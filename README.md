# Global-Climate-Change-Forecasting
Advanced Time Series analysis and forecasting of global CO2 levels and temperature using Linear Regression and Moving Averages. Large-scale environmental data modeling.
# 🌍 Global Climate Change & Air Quality Forecasting

## 🚀 Overview
This project tackles one of the most critical challenges in environmental data science: **Predicting Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emission trends**. Using a decade of simulated daily data, this model implements time-series smoothing and linear forecasting.

## 🧬 Technical Complexity
- **Time-Series Modeling:** Applied **Moving Averages (30-day window)** to filter high-frequency noise and extract underlying climate trends.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Implemented a **Linear Regression** model to forecast CO2 levels for the next 730 days.
- **Data Seasonality:** Simulated realistic seasonal variations using **Sinusoidal functions** to mimic annual climate cycles.

## 📈 Key Achievements
- Efficiently processed daily records for a **10-year period**.
- Successfully visualized the "Trend vs Noise" relationship in environmental datasets.
- Developed a scalable forecasting architecture applicable to real-world sensors.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python / Pandas** (Time-Series Handling)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Predictive Modeling)
- **Matplotlib** (Scientific Plotting)
